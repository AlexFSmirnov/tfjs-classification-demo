And, of course, if you want to know the details, feel free to check out the code.

Colab kicks you after 90 minutes of inactivity, so you can't leave the model training unattended. A simple workaround for this is to run this code in your browser console:\n","```js\n","const clickConnect = () => {\n","    var connectButton = document\n","        .querySelector('#top-toolbar > colab-connect-button')\n","        .shadowRoot.querySelector('#connect');\n"," \n","    connectButton.click();\n","    console.log(`Clicked at ${new Date()}`);\n","};\n"," \n","intervalId = setInterval(clickConnect, 600000);\n","```\n","This will click a button in Colab every 10 minutes. To stop it, use this:\n","```js\n","window.clearInterval(intervalId);\n","```\n","\n","Remember though, Colab will still kick you after 12 hours of usage, so don't forget to save your files to an external source!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sysRklLbWqRR"},"source":["# Code"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"anvymdbLSqvc"},"source":["## Prepare workspace"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZRapLd7LS-PO"},"source":["### Define common variables"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KLWbZisUS7lO"},"source":["IMAGE_SIZE = 32\n","\n","EPOCHS = 300\n","\n","BATCH_SIZE = 32\n","VALIDATION_SPLIT = 0.2\n","RANDOM_SEED = 0\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e7CJaVdEVZkm"},"source":["### Install libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"akwrWit0Va22"},"source":["!pip install tensorflowjs"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CzrPUR1laQG7"},"source":["!apt install rar"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UXmq9oLKVXi_"},"source":["### Fetch dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KWof-7BWOsjp"},"source":["# Download the dataset from GDrive\n","!gdown --id \"1F98iX3a2AwOP7anep_ybUul-fuwfL6qM\" --output characters.rar"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"al8cerZnQZJS"},"source":["# Unrar it to ./characters/\n","!rm -r characters\n","!unrar x -idq characters.rar"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2FZChYZmSy-P"},"source":["## Create, train and export the model"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DpnH6fetS6KU"},"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import tensorflowjs as tfjs\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","\n","# Create train and validation datasets\n","raw_train_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(\n","    'characters',\n","    validation_split=VALIDATION_SPLIT,\n","    subset='training',\n","    seed=RANDOM_SEED,\n","    image_size=(IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE),\n","    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE\n",")\n","\n","raw_val_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(\n","    'characters',\n","    validation_split=VALIDATION_SPLIT,\n","    subset='validation',\n","    seed=RANDOM_SEED,\n","    image_size=(IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE),\n","    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE\n",")\n","\n","classes = raw_train_ds.class_names\n","num_classes = len(classes)\n","print(f'Class names ({num_classes}):', classes)\n","\n","# Normalize images (map pixel values from 0-255 to 0-1)\n","normalization_layer = layers.experimental.preprocessing.Rescaling(1./255)\n","train_ds = raw_train_ds.map(lambda x, y: (normalization_layer(x), y))\n","val_ds = raw_val_ds.map(lambda x, y: (normalization_layer(x), y))\n","\n","# Create a simple sequential model\n","model = Sequential([\n","    layers.Conv2D(16, 3, padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, 3)),\n","    layers.MaxPooling2D(),\n","    layers.Conv2D(32, 3, padding='same', activation='relu'),\n","    layers.MaxPooling2D(),\n","    layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same', activation='relu'),\n","    layers.MaxPooling2D(),\n","    layers.Flatten(),\n","    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n","    layers.Dense(num_classes)\n","])\n","\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n","              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n","              metrics=['accuracy'])\n","\n","# Train the model\n","history = model.fit(\n","    train_ds,\n","    validation_data=val_ds,\n","    epochs=EPOCHS,\n",")\n","\n","# Once training is done, convert the model to a TensorFlowJS LayersModel and save it\n","print('Training finished, saving the model...
